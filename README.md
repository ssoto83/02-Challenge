# Horiseon Webpage Refactoring 

Horiseon is a marketing company looking to optimized the site for search engines and improve accessibility.

## User Story:
AS a marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards   
WHEN I view the source code     
THEN I find semantic HTML elements      
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements      
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning     
WHEN I view the icon and image elements     
THEN I find accessible alt attributes       
WHEN I view the heading attributes      
THEN they fall in sequential order  
WHEN I view the title element       
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Project Status
Changed the title, consolidaded classes, added comments and attributes and removed repetitive styling in CSS. For the moment being I am finished with the project.
